## Project Title: NexFlow - AI-Powered Workflow Manager

### Problem Statement

Managing multiple developer tools and platforms can be time-consuming and inefficient. Developers often switch between various tools like GitHub, Jira, and Postman, which disrupts their workflow and reduces productivity. NexFlow addresses this problem by integrating these tools into a unified platform powered by AI, enabling seamless task automation and management.
